HTTP:
    HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol, and it is the basis for almost all web applications.
    HTTP is the method computers and servers use to request and send information.
    first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1 and a new version of HTTP is called HTTP/2.

Difference between HTTP1 and HTTP2:
       HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it. In contrast, HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
       Typically, a server only serves content to a client device if the client asks for it. However, this approach is not always practical for modern webpages, which often involve several dozen separate resources that the client must request. HTTP/2 solves this problem by allowing a server to "push" content to a client before the client asks for it.
       To speed up web performance, both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 compress HTTP messages to make them smaller. However, HTTP/2 uses a more advanced compression method called HPACK that eliminates redundant information in HTTP header packets.
